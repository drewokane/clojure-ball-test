# Unity Roll-a-ball with Arcadia

## Getting started with Arcadia
Firstly, stroll on over to the [Arcadia github page](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia) and 
follow the instructions for setting up your Unity project to use Arcadia. The simplest method is
to clone the project into your Assets folder, i.e.

```
cd path/to/unity/project/Assets
git clone https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia.git
```

After you've cloned Arcadia, make sure Unity is running in the background and uses the full .NET API.

have a few choices in terms of editor:

1. Emacs
